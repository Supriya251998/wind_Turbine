# Predictive Maintenance System for Wind Turbines with XAI-Enhanced Explanations
This project is part of a thesis that explores the usability of various Explainable AI (XAI) techniques integrated into a predictive maintenance system for wind turbines. The system is built using Streamlit and Docker, and provides an interactive user interface for exploring machine learning model predictions with multiple XAI methods (SHAP, Anchor, Counterfactual). These explanations are enhanced with natural language descriptions generated by the open-source LLM Llama 3, allowing users to better understand and interpret the model outputs.

## **ðŸ“– Project Overview**

This Streamlit application serves as a case study for demonstrating how LLM-generated explanations can improve user comprehension of machine learning model predictions. It enables users to view explanations that meet different needs, identified through user-centered design research.

### Key Features

- **Fault Prediction Model**: Predicts wind turbine faults using an XGBoost model optimized with Optuna and tracked via MLflow.
- **Interactive Explanations**: Includes multiple XAI methods:
  - **SHAP** for feature importance
  - **Anchor** for decision-making rules
  - **Counterfactuals** for actionable insights
- **LLM-Enhanced Explanations**: Provides natural language explanations using Llama 3 to help users understand model outputs.
