# Predictive Maintenance System for Wind Turbines with XAI-Enhanced Explanations
This project is part of a thesis that explores the usability of various Explainable AI (XAI) techniques integrated into a predictive maintenance system for wind turbines. The system is built using Streamlit and Docker, and provides an interactive user interface for exploring machine learning model predictions with multiple XAI methods (SHAP, Anchor, Counterfactual). These explanations are enhanced with natural language descriptions generated by the open-source LLM Llama 3, allowing users to better understand and interpret the model outputs.
