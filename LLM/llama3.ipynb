      "**Prediction Insights:**\n",
      "For this instance, the target class is \"Faulty\", which means the model predicts that the turbine component is faulty. Let's look at the top 3 features that contributed most to this prediction:\n",
      "\n",
      "* The average grid rotor inverter phase 2 temperature had a high positive SHAP value, indicating it was one of the main factors contributing to the faulty prediction.\n",
