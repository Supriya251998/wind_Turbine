      "**Component:** The GEARBOX component plays a crucial role in the overall functioning of the system. It's responsible for transmitting power and torque to other components, ensuring smooth operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Anchor Condition:** The anchor condition states that if the maximum rotor rotations per minute exceed 14.80, it indicates a potential issue with the gearbox's performance or efficiency. In practical terms, this means that if the gearbox is operating at an unusually high speed, it may be experiencing problems that need attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Precision:** With a precision value of 0.99, the model is extremely confident in its prediction that the gearbox is non-faulty. This suggests that the model has accurately identified the correct outcome based on the input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Coverage:** The coverage value of 0.72 indicates that the model's predictions are applicable to approximately 72% of the possible scenarios or inputs. This means that while the model is reliable, it may not be suitable for all situations or edge cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Implications:** These values collectively suggest that the model has high confidence in its prediction and is well-suited for most scenarios where the gearbox is non-faulty. However, there may be some limitations to its applicability, particularly in extreme or unusual conditions. As a result, it's essential to consider these factors when interpreting the model's output and making decisions based on its predictions.\n"
